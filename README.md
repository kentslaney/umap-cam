# UMAP
This repo provides a JAX implementation of UMAP and a color space (CIECAM16-UCS)
that points can be embedded into along with spacial dimensions. It also features
an updated data structure that should be more cache friendly.

## Project Status
Visual results are on their way and should be up later this week.
